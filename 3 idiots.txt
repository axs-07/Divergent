[The room is quiet. Books are scattered everywhere. A fan hums loudly.]

Farhan: Do you ever feel like you’re running, but you don’t know where you’re going?

Raju: I feel that every single day. I keep thinking—what if I fail? What happens then?

Rancho: Why do you both assume failure before even trying?

Raju: Because some of us don’t have the luxury of trying again. One mistake and everything collapses.

Farhan: My parents think they know what’s best for me. Maybe they do. But it doesn’t feel right.

Rancho: Living someone else’s dream will never feel right.

Raju: Dreams don’t pay bills, Rancho.

Rancho: Fear doesn’t either.

Farhan: Easy for you to say. You’re not constantly worried about disappointing people.

Rancho: Disappointing yourself lasts much longer.

[Silence for a moment.]

Raju: I study every day, but the fear never leaves. It’s like no matter how much I prepare, it’s never enough.

Rancho: That’s because you’re studying to survive, not to understand.


Chatur: study study tension books education boring
Director: competition pressure degree study no fun
Pia: smile pretty happy lively
Farhan: Then what are we supposed to do?

Rancho: Stop asking what will happen if you fail. Ask what happens if you never try.

Raju: I just want a stable life.

Rancho: Stability without happiness is just slow suffocation.

Farhan: I wish someone told us this before everything became so complicated.

Rancho: Life was always complicated. We just didn’t notice.

[The fan keeps spinning. The three sit quietly, lost in thought.]
